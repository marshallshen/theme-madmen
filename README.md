Mad Men theme for Jekyll Bootstrap
==========================
Inspired by [Dinky CSS](https://github.com/broccolini/dinky), I wrote Mad Men theme while camping on my couch watching it on Netflix:-)

If you use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) as your primary blog engine, you can install this theme by run the following command line:

````
rake theme:install git="https://github.com/marshallshen/theme-madmen.git"
````

The visual demo of the theme:
